Patient-centred, tech-enabled healthcare coordination and operations system

## What is CODEX One Care?

CODEX One Care is a patient-centred, tech-enabled healthcare coordination and operations model designed to help healthcare facilities deliver better care, improve efficiency, and make data-driven decisions.

It focuses on aligning clinical care, operations, finance, and patient experience into one coordinated system.

## Why It Exists

Many healthcare facilities struggle with:
- Fragmented patient records
- Poor care continuity
- Inefficient operations
- Limited financial visibility
- Weak data for decision-making

CODEX One Care addresses these gaps through structured care coordination and digital systems.

## Focus Areas

- Care coordination
- Digital health systems (EMR & data)
- Operational & financial intelligence
- Patient experience improvement
## Current Status

Early-stage project focused on pilot development and documentation.
