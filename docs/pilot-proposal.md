# CODEX One Care – Pilot Proposal

**Project:** CODEX One Care – Patient-Centred Healthcare Coordination & Operations System
**Prepared by:** Blessing Osahenruwen Enagbare
**Date:** December 2025

## 1. Executive Summary

Healthcare facilities in Nigeria and similar resource-constrained settings face multiple operational challenges, including fragmented patient records, poor care continuity, inefficient workflows, and limited visibility into financial and clinical performance. These gaps reduce patient satisfaction, increase operational costs, and limit the ability of facilities to make data-driven decisions.

**CODEX One Care** is a patient-centred, technology-enabled model that integrates care coordination, digital health infrastructure, operations, and financial management to improve healthcare delivery. This pilot aims to implement CODEX One Care in 1–2 healthcare facilities in Kaduna, demonstrate measurable improvements in patient care, operational efficiency, and financial oversight, and establish a scalable model for broader adoption.

**Budget:** ₦3,000,000 (No hardware included)

## 2. Pilot Objectives

1. **Implement CODEX One Care system** in selected healthcare facility(ies) to improve care coordination and operational efficiency.
2. **Digitize patient journeys** for better record-keeping, follow-up, and continuity of care.
3. **Strengthen operational and financial visibility** through dashboards and reporting tools.
4. **Train staff and facility teams** to adopt the system sustainably.
5. **Collect measurable data** to evaluate impact and refine the model for scale.

## 3. Pilot Facilities

**Target:** 1–2 mid-sized hospitals/clinics in Kaduna with:

* Basic digital readiness (computers or tablets available)
* Willingness to participate in process mapping and training
* Minimum patient volume of 50–100 daily visits

**Example Facilities:**

1. Facility A – Private clinic with 50 staff, general outpatient & chronic care
2. Facility B – Community hospital with 80 staff, multi-department operations

> Selection will be finalized after initial assessment and MOUs.

## 4. CODEX One Care Pilot Model

### 4.1 Care Coordination

* Map patient journey from registration → consultation → follow-up
* Track referrals, chronic care plans, and follow-ups
* Reduce repeated tests and improve patient satisfaction

### 4.2 Digital Health Infrastructure

* Configure EMR system for the facility
* Set up dashboards for operations and finance
* Track patient volumes, visits, and outcomes

### 4.3 Operations & Finance

* Train finance staff to monitor costs, revenue, and departmental performance
* Generate operational insights for better decision-making
* Provide monthly reports on care quality and resource utilization

### 4.4 Training & Adoption

* Staff training workshops (administrative, clinical, finance)
* Hands-on sessions on using dashboards, EMR, and workflow tools
* Identify “champions” in each facility to sustain adoption
